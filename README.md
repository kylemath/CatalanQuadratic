# Polynomial Solutions via Hexagon Triangulation

🚀 **[Live Demo](https://kylemath.github.io/CatalanQuadratic)** 🚀

## Description
An interactive web application visualizing the connection between hexagon triangulations and polynomial solutions, inspired by the paper "A Hyper-Catalan Series Solution to Polynomial Equations, and the Geode" by Norman Wildberger and Dean Rubine. This application provides an intuitive geometric interpretation of how polynomial solutions relate to triangulations of regular polygons.

## Features
* Interactive 3D visualization of hexagon triangulations
* Visual representation of polynomial roots and their geometric connection
* Support for exploring different triangulation patterns
* Modern UI with crystal-like aesthetics

## Current Implementation
The application currently focuses on the quadratic equation case (1-x-x² = 0), demonstrating how its solutions relate to hexagon triangulations. The visualization shows:

1. A regular hexagon with different triangulation patterns
2. A number line displaying the roots of the polynomial equation
3. Visual connections between the triangulation patterns and the polynomial roots

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Three.js for 3D rendering

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Use the slider or buttons to explore different triangulation patterns

## Project Roadmap
- [x] Initial setup with basic structure and UI
- [x] Implement visualization for the 1-x-x² = 0 case
- [x] Create interactive controls for exploring triangulations
- [ ] Add support for cubic polynomial equations
- [ ] Implement full visualization of the 14 possible hexagon triangulations
- [ ] Add educational explanations about Catalan numbers and their relation to triangulations
- [ ] Extend to higher-degree polynomial equations and corresponding polygons

## Related Research
This visualization is based on the mathematical work presented in "A Hyper-Catalan Series Solution to Polynomial Equations, and the Geode" which explores a novel approach to solving polynomial equations using combinatorial structures and geometric interpretations.
